The bill would make it more difficult for consumers to have their contact lens prescriptions filled by companies like Costco that offer lower prices than many independent eye doctors. It would also improperly pre-empt an independent examination of the contact lens industry currently being undertaken by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission . In 2003, Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act, which allows contact lens wearers access to their prescriptions and enables them to shop at retail stores, warehouse clubs, or online providers for prices lower than their prescribers offer.
