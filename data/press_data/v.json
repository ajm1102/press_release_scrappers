As COVID-19 case counts fell, consumer spending momentum resumed its robust pace of expansion. The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. Consumer spending momentum gained strength across all age groups, helping to reverse a three-month slide. The growth was fastest in U.S. consumers over the age of 65, helping to close a gap that had opened between that cohort and younger U.S. consumers (aged 25-44) during the pandemic. Spending momentum by older U.S. consumers lagged an average of 9.1 index points from March 2020 through January 2022, and reached as high as 17.2 points in November 2020. In February",

(NYSE:V) today announced it had decided to deposit $450 million (the “Loss Funds”) into the litigation escrow account previously established under the Company’s retrospective responsibility plan (the “Plan”). Under the terms of the Plan, when the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the value of the Company’s Class B shares – which are held exclusively by U.S. financial institutions and their affiliates and successors – are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, by reducing the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. The deposit of the Loss Funds will be conducted in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation currently in effect.
