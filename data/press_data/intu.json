Because Intuit’s fiscal 2018 year started in August 2017, it will be subject to IRS rules relating to transitional tax rates in fiscal 2018. Under tax law (Internal Revenue Code Section 15), if the tax rate changes during a taxable year, the tax rate for the full year is calculated using the prior and new tax rates on a proportional basis using the number of days under each tax rate. “Tax reform results in fewer corporate deductions. As a result, beyond the transitional year in fiscal 2018 we expect our GAAP and long-term structural non-GAAP rate could be closer to or higher than the new statutory rate,” said Neil Williams , Intuit’s executive vice president and chief financial officer.
